    "There’s no way Pytorch(or any other framework for that matter) could predict what the input dimensionality of a network would be. Later on, when working with convolutional networks and images this problem will become even more pertinent, since the input dimensionality (i.e. the resolution of an image) will affect the dimensionality of subsequent layers at a long range. Hence, <font color=red>the ability to set parameters without the need to know at the time of writing the code what the dimensionality</font> is can greatly simplify statistical modeling. In what follows, we will discuss how this works using initialization as an example. After all, we cannot initialize variables that we don’t know exist."
